## What's this?
{: .fs-9 }

Atomic NFTs make it possible to sign and own pieces of the public decentralized data commons. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

To see some Atomic content in action, you can get [Koii's Finnie Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/finnie/cjmkndjhnagcfbpiemnkdpomccnjblmj) or browse some content from the community on the [koi.rocks attention leaderboard](https://koi.rocks/).

## Why use Atomic NFTs?
- Storage Networks like [Arweave](https://arweave.org) have incredibly low gas fees (mint each NFT for less than $00.01)
- Much less energy is used, since Atomic NFTs use [Proofs of Real Traffic](https://koii.network/proofs-of-real-traffic.pdf) instead of Proof of Work
- Utilities can be added with [Gradual Consensus](https://koii.network/gradual-consensus.pdf)
- Media files are stored with contracts that control their ownership. They can never be separated.
- All content receives KOII tokens any time it is viewed with [attention rewards](https://koii.network/lightpaper.pdf))
