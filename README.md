# Docs for the Atomic NFT Standard
The Atomic NFT standard is documented on [atomicnft.com](https://atomicnft.com). This repo contains the source files and example code, and can be easily edited by anyone with a github account.

To suggest edits, the easiest way is to open the site at atomicnft.com, then click the 'Suggest edits on github' button in the bottom right hand corner. 

This will take you to the correct file, and then you can submit edits using the Github.com interface and the site will update once the changes are merged to master. 

For more information about Atomic NFTs, and to see the leaderboard, you'll want to visit [koi.rocks](https://koi.rocks/).
