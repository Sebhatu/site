## Dynamic
{: .fs-9 }

Dynamic NFTs are quite a bit more complicated, and use an iframe compressed into an html payload to prepare a final payload. 

The dynamic element comes from the NFT's internal programming, which can retrieve information from an Arweave gateway, and can change their appearance to respond to the latest contract state. 

[Try out the 'Narcissus' flower template here to give it a try.](https://github.com/atomic-nfts/standard/tree/main/dynamic)

This is only an example of the implementation, but can provides the default functionality needed for interoperability with existing Atomic NFT standards.
