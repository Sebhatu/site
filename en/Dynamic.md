# Dynamic

{: .fs-9 }

Dynamic NFTs are quite a bit more complicated, and use an iframe compressed into an html payload to prepare a final payload.

The dynamic element comes from the NFTâ€™s internal programming, which can retrieve information from an Arweave gateway, and can change their appearance to respond to the latest contract state.

Try out the ['Narcissus Flower' template](https://github.com/atomic-nfts/standard/tree/main/dynamic) here to give it a try.

This is only one example of the implementation, but it provides the default functionality needed for interoperability with existing Atomic NFT standards.
