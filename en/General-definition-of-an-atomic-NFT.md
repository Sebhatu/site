# General definition of an atomic NFT

## What is an Atomic NFT?

{: .fs-9 }

An Atomic NFT is a standard for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) where the media assets and contract metadata are stored together immutably under a single unique identifier.

Anyone can use the Atomic NFT standard to tokenize and create digital assets and buy, sell, and auction assets through the marketplace.

The Koii Network facilitates a range of services associated with Atomic NFTs by default, and most of these are commission-lite or commission-free. Because Atomic NFTs all follow a common standard, they are interchangable in all compatible applications, as well as bridges to other chains and formats like Ethereum (and EVM), Tezos, and Polkadot.
